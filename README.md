# Minesweeper
## Project By Robin Hwang, Alex Holden, Ava Fu, Keith Burroughs, Kevin Zhang, Ananth Narayan
### Information: This project was completed to satisfy the requirements of the Web Development Bootcamp of the University of Pennsylvania.

Minesweeper is a two-dimensional logic puzzle/game in which users try to clear the entire grid by clicking cell by cell without accidentally clicking on a mine.

HTML and CSS were utilized to design a user interface. Javascript was used to plan out and execute the logic behind the game.

Thank you to Michael Eiseman for guiding us through this project.
